A script that places shift times from a pdf onto google calendar for ease of access among work members

I used this script at my work so I could easily read when I was working on my phone with just the calendar widget.

I removed PII and token information for privacy reasons. the runME.py is the primary file you use. There were plans to implement a GUI using tkinter but I stopped working there at the end of the summer and didnt see the need to keep working on it.

The two screenshots with bladked out names are an example of what the script would read and interpret.
